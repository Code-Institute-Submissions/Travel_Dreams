<h1>Concept idea</h1>
the concept idea for project 1 is to design and build a website to help promote and expose my cousin's travel business. She has a strong presence on social media, but having a website would help with the expansion of her business. This is because the purpose of the site is to provide potential clients with information about the services provided, alongside a visual portfolio.

<h1>Page Layout</h1>
There will be four pages on the site: main sections on the page, an 'about' section which gives information about the business and the owner, FAQs to improve customer experience by providing information without them having to wait for a response, and a 'contact' form which will allow visitors to fill in their details on a form and submit them to the business email adress about queries and potential bookings.

<h1>Website Purpose</h1>
To provide a point of contact for new potential (and existing) clients for the business. Visually display information about the business and increase exposure by adding more online presence to compliment her current Facebook and Instagram pages. Families/couples looking to book a holiday with personal travel assistant. Ashleigh specialises in family holidays, Disney breaks, Lapland getaways and occasionally, abroad weddings. This means holiday makers who typically book adventurous, long term, international travels are excluded from the skope of design and audience as there is no reason to explictly cater for this niche customer base in her field.

<h1>Organisation</h1>
<ul>
<li>created all the files needed in the project - 2x.html files, a style.css file nested in an assets folder, along with an 'images' folder nested inside that.</li>

<li>Add code for the 'head' and 'body' section for the 'index.html file', making sure to link it to the 'style.css' sheet using 'href' attribute.</li>
